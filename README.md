# Overview

This repository contains code, data processing pipelines, and model training/inference scripts for a **Regional Fake News Detection** system targeting Balochistan and related regional languages (Urdu / local dialects). The project focuses on identifying misinformation in social media posts, news snippets, and short text articles using classical ML and modern transformer-based NLP approaches, with careful preprocessing for non-standard orthography and code-switching.

---

# Key Features

* Support for Urdu and regional dialect text (tokenization & normalization).
* Dataset processing pipeline (raw → cleaned → labeled → train/val/test).
* Baseline models: TF-IDF + classical classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM).
* Transformer-based classifier (fine-tunable, e.g., multilingual/BERT or Urdu-specific models).
* Evaluation scripts with standard metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC).
* Inference module and example REST API (Flask) for serving predictions.
* Logging of model decisions for auditability and error analysis.

---

# Motivation & Scope

Misinformation spreads rapidly in local communities where resources for moderation and fact checking are limited. This project aims to:

* Provide an automatic first-pass filter for potentially false claims in regional languages.
* Support human moderators by prioritizing suspicious content.
* Be adaptable to additional regional data and continually improve with active learning.

**Scope limits:** This is *not* a fact-checking oracle — it flags likely misinformation based on linguistic and contextual signals. Human verification is required for final decisions.

# Installation

Recommended: create a Python virtual environment (Python 3.8+).

```bash
# create venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

pandas
scikit-learn
transformers
torch
sentencepiece
flask
gunicorn
tqdm
pyyaml
regex
urduhack        # optional: helpful Urdu text tools (if available)
```

*(Adjust versions as needed — pin versions in production.)*

# Data

Place raw data under `data/raw/`. The project expects a labeled CSV/JSON with at minimum:

| column   | description                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | unique identifier                                             |
| `text`   | raw text (post/article headline/body)                         |
| `label`  | `fake` / `real` / `satire` / `unverified` (string or numeric) |
| `source` | optional: URL or platform                                     |
| `date`   | optional: publication/scrape date                             |
| `lang`   | optional: language code (e.g., `ur`)                          |

**Label schema:** Keep labels consistent. Recommended mapping for binary classification: `fake` → `1`, `real` → `0`. For multiclass, document mapping in `data/annotations/label_map.json`.

# Preprocessing

`src/data_processing.py` implements:

* Unicode normalization and whitespace cleanup.
* Urdu-specific normalization (e.g., different forms of ye/hamza, diacritics removal).
* Tokenization (subword for transformers or whitespace/ngram for classical models).
* Optional transliteration or romanization handling for code-switched content.
* Stopword removal and stemming (if used).

Run:

```bash
python src/data_processing.py --input data/raw/train.csv --output data/processed/train_clean.csv
```

---

# Models & Training

Two primary pipelines are included:

### 1. Baseline (TF-IDF + Classifier)

* Vectorize with `TfidfVectorizer` (n-grams: 1-2).
* Classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest.
* Fast, interpretable baseline.

Train:

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/tfidf_lr.yaml
```

### 2. Transformer-based (fine-tune)

* Use multilingual or Urdu-supporting models, e.g., `bert-base-multilingual-cased`, `urdu-bert` (if available).
* Fine-tune with class-balanced sampling, learning rate scheduling, and checkpointing.

Train:

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/bert_finetune.yaml
```

Configuration files in `configs/` control hyperparameters, paths, and training options.

---

# Evaluation

Evaluation metrics are computed in `src/evaluate.py`. Standard outputs:

* Precision, Recall, F1 (macro & per-class)
* Confusion matrix
* ROC-AUC (for binary)
* Precision-Recall curve

Run evaluation on saved checkpoints:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model models/best.pt --data data/processed/test_clean.csv --output experiments/results.json
```

---

# Usage (Inference)

Quick inference from command-line:

```bash
python src/inference.py --model models/best.pt --text "یہ خبر سچی ہے یا جھوٹی؟"
```

Batch inference:

```bash
python src/inference.py --model models/best.pt --input data/samples/unlabeled.csv --output data/samples/predictions.csv
```

`src/inference.py` returns standardized JSON with fields: `id`, `text`, `pred_label`, `score` (confidence).

---

# REST API (example)

An example Flask server is provided in `src/api/app.py`. Minimal usage:

```bash
# launch
cd src/api
gunicorn -w 4 app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Example request:

```http
POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json

{ "id": "123", "text": "مقامی خبر کا متن یہاں" }
```

Response:

```json
{ "id": "123", "pred_label": "fake", "score": 0.87 }
```

---

# Deployment

* Containerize with Docker (provide `Dockerfile` in repo root for production).
* Use Gunicorn or Uvicorn (FastAPI) for serving.
* For small deployments, model quantization or ONNX conversion is recommended to reduce latency.
* Use logging + monitoring for model drift; schedule periodic retraining with new labeled data.

---

# Results & Expected Outputs

Include experiment logs and sample evaluation results under `experiments/`. Document:

* Dataset split sizes (train/val/test counts).
* Best model hyperparameters.
* Best reported metrics (e.g., F1, Precision/Recall).

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome:

1. Fork repository.
2. Create a feature branch.

# Ethical Considerations & Limitations

* **Human-in-the-loop:** Outputs are recommendations. Always require human verification for sensitive moderation actions.
* **Bias & Fairness:** Models trained on biased or limited data can amplify bias. Document dataset origin and sampling biases.
* **Privacy:** Remove PII and respect local privacy laws when collecting data.
* **Transparency:** Provide explanations where possible (e.g., top features or attention snippets) to aid human reviewers.

# References & Suggested Reading

* Research on misinformation detection (list canonical papers here).
* Language tools and tokenizers for Urdu (e.g., **Urduhack**, `CLTK` where applicable).
* Transformer models and Hugging Face documentation.
